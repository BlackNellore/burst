:ref:`Hello Burst!<hello_burst_page>`
------------------

This simple example illustrates how to use ``burst`` to launch a GPU, verify the hardware available, and then shut down the server.

:ref:`CIFAR-10: a CNN for Image Recognition<cifar10_page>`
--------------

We strongly recommend walking through the CIFAR-10 example, which uses Pytorch to train a Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) for image classification on the benchmark CIFAR-10 computer vision dataset. This example also illustrates how to use burst to run a Jupyter notebook on a remote GPU, for real-time model building and manipulation on a GPU.

:ref:`Your Python Project<your_python_project_page>`
--------------------------

If your project is a pure Python project, you should be able to get it running through burst using the simple templates provided here.
