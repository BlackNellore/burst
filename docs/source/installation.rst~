Installation
============

*Note: if you want to contribute to the burst OSS project or just follow bleeding-edge development, install through gitHub as described `here <https://github.com/burstable-ai/burst/wiki/Contributing-To-Burst>`_ instead.*

SSH keys:
You must have a public/private ssh key pair, stored as ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa by default.

If you do not already have ssh keys, run ssh-keygen to generate them:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Recommended: set up a Python virtual environment
Follow the instructions here: python-virtual-environments-a-primer

Launch the virtual environment and do the remainder of your installation and set-up inside the virtual environment.

Check versions of Python and Docker at the command line
Make sure you are running the necessary versions of python and Docker (you need Python 3, Docker >= 19)

python --version
docker --version
Install the command-line tool:
pip install burstable
Run the interactive configuration setup:
burst configure
Enter your configuration information as prompted to set up a remote compute service.

Test the installation:
Test your installation of burst by running the test example provided here.
