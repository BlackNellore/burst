# burst
## A command-line tool to remotely execute code in the cloud

## Introduction

`burst` lets you run your software remotely in the cloud, on powerful GPU's or multi-CPU hardware instances that are
booted up and stopped automatically, so you only pay for the time you use.

We support remote computing on Amazon Web Services and will be adding more 
(Google Cloud Platform support is currently in beta).
