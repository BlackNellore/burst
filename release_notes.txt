Release notes for burst 1.1.1

Changes in CLI:

This release represents a major overhaul of the Command Line Interface (CLI). A number of options were recast as 'actions', or
top-level commands that then support various options. These commands are positional arguments, meaning they are not
preceded by a dash '-' or double-dash '--'.

'burst --help' has been expanded to document all the available options.

The actions and their usage can be seen by typing 'burst actions'.

For existing users, here is a cheat sheet to support migration to the new syntax:

old                                                       new
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
burst --build                                             burst build --gpu | --no-gpu
burst python3 myprog.py                                   burst run python3 myprog.py
burst --shutdown [seconds]                                burst stop-server | burst --stop-server seconds
burst --verbosity ...                                     burst --verbose | -v ...
burst --background ...                                    burst --background | -b ...
burst --gpus [none|all]                                   burst --gpu | --no-gpu
burst --list                                              burst list-servers
burst --status                                            burst status
burst --attach                                            burst attach

similar options that are now actions: kill, sync, configure, terminate-server

Note both actions and options can be abbreviated:

burst --verb 1 list

options can come before or after the main action, but the task to run must come last:

burst --verb 1 run --stop 300 python3 myprog.py

As presently implemented, all options are valid for all actions, although they may not be applicable.
This behavior is not guaranteed to remain forever.
